Giveaway

Inspired by Colby College's annual RESCUE sale, I created a webapp that allows people to help save the environment easier than ever by giving away their goods. It is also intended to provide much easier access to doing good deeds and bridge all kinds of people together :) Check it out! Anyone who is interested in helping me out, reach out to me jlee@colby.edu!
